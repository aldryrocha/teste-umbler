# @aldryrocha' Teste Umbler

This is a old challenge to a job opportunity as a front-end developer at the Umbler company, made with [HTML5, SASS and Vanilla JS, bundled with Parcel]. 
The test was posted on github [https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges](https://github.com/felipefialho/frontend-challenges) 

You can see it live at [teste-umbler.vercel.app](https://teste-umbler.vercel.app/).

## Installing

If you want to install this project locally and make changes, follow these three very simple steps:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:aldryrocha/teste-umbler-portfolio
$ cd teste-umbler-portfolio
$ npm i
```

Now you have this repo in your local machine! Let's run [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) and start making changes

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Now the Teste Umbler wil be live on [localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234). You can edit anything, save it, and your browser will reload the page to show your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost.

## Building and deploying

To build a production-ready version of the project, run:

```bash
$ npm run prod
```

You can run the newly built app with `npm run dev`.

### Deploying

#### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

If you never used Vercel before, you need to install it:

```bash
$ npm install -g vercel
```

(You also need to create an account at <vercel.com>).

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash
$ cd public
$ vercel deploy
```
